# bulldozar_auction_price_prediction

Hey there, we were assigned with a new problem.
> We were asked to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations([Source](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)).

So, How do we tackle?

They are asking us to predict the auction Salesprice of the product based on the data we were given.

Okay, so we will be following the given steps to get to our solution:-

1.   Download a real-world dataset and analyse it.
2.   Explore and visualise the data.
3.   Cleaning and feature engineering of the data.
4.   Train the First ML model on the dataset.
5.   Tune hyperperameters and regularization.
6.   Doing the 4 and 5 steps for the second and thrid ML model.
7.   Making predictions and submitting the predictions.

8.   Saving the model.
9.  Summary and references.

Now before starting, let's download the essential libraries and commit to jovian and then let's get started.


Let's summarise the work we have done throughout the notebook:-

The following topics were covered in this tutorial:

Downloading a real-world dataset from a Kaggle competition.
Performing feature engineering and prepare the dataset for training.
Training and interpreting a gradient boosting model using XGBoost.
Configuring the gradient boosting model and tuning hyperparamters.
Comparing the model with other types of models like linear Regression and Random Forest.
Predicting on Testset.
Saving the model as a .joblib file.
